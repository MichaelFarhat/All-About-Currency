# All About Currency
## Describtion
All About Currency is a project that counts the rates of all the existend currencies in the world based on any currencies, which the user can pick. In the Home section the rates from from the this and the last seven years of the most imoprtant currencies will be counted. In the Currency section the user can pick any currency he wants to see the rates of this currency from the last months of this year, as well as the rates from this and the last seven years. In the Conversion section the user can convert any currency to any currency.  
All the information in the Home and in the Currency sections are reprisented as a statistical chart using the library chartJs. https://www.chartjs.org.  
The Api I used to get the rates is the fixer api. https://fixer.io.  
The fixer api with none paid subscribtion give you the rates based on EUR. You can't change the base or convert currencies unless you subscirbe with a paid plan. But in this project the base is manually encounted as well as the conversion.
